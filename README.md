# IMAGE-ANNOTATION

TASK 1(OBJECT DETECTOR):
The interesting application for object detection is counting the num-
ber of objects.The obect detection helps to assist the human operators
by implementing intelligent visual surviving systems.In object trac-
ing we use image measurements to estimate position of object, but
also incorporate position predicted by dynamics.

Load the image.Convert the image into grey scale.
Complement the image after grey scale.
Using the connected component algorithm count the number of objects in the complemented image.
